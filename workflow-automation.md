# Use Case: Automate Your Workflows

This use case demonstrates how the Gemini CLI can be used to perform a series of file system operations, summarize the interaction, and perform cleanup tasks.

### Prompts

```bash
# Navigate the file system
enter into the Downloads
list all the folders
enter into gemini-cli

# Analyze directory contents
count the number of coding files it has
separate the images and pdf and other files

# Summarize and log interactions
make a summary of my interactions with the CLI
add it in a summary.md file
append new interactions to the same file

# Perform cleanup
delete the .txt files
