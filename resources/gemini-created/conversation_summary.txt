This is a summary of the conversation so far:

1.  The user and I started in the home directory `C:\Users\charan`.
2.  I couldn't find a `gemini-cli` folder in the home directory.
3.  I navigated into the `C:\Users\charan\Downloads` directory at the user's request.
4.  Inside the `Downloads` directory, I found and entered the `Gemini-cli` folder.
5.  I listed the contents of the `Gemini-cli` folder and categorized them by file type (images, videos, documents, etc.) at the user's request.
6.  I answered the user's questions about the number of pictures (12) and code-related files (2) in that folder.
7.  I created a new folder named `gemini-created` inside the `Gemini-cli` folder.
8.  I am currently inside the `C:\Users\charan\Downloads\Gemini-cli\gemini-created` directory.
